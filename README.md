# All-The-Words-That-I-Know

This is a game where the player enters as many words as they know, and that's it. The program will tell you if you've entered in 
a word more than once, or if you haven't entered in a word at all.

In /game there is a game.py file which has the same functionality as the main.py file, but it features a Score and High Score along the top of the screen.
